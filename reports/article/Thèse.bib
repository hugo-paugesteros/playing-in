  abstract = {In mathematics, the moments of a function are certain quantitative measures related to the shape of the function's graph. If the function represents mass density, then the zeroth moment is the total mass, the first moment (normalized by total mass) is the center of mass, and the second moment is the moment of inertia. If the function is a probability distribution, then the first moment is the expected value, the second central moment is the variance, the third standardized moment is the skewness, and the fourth standardized moment is the kurtosis. The mathematical concept is closely related to the concept of moment in physics. For a distribution of mass or probability on a bounded interval, the collection of all the moments (of all orders, from 0 to {$\infty$}) uniquely determines the distribution (Hausdorff moment problem).  The same is not true on unbounded intervals (Hamburger moment problem). In the mid-nineteenth century, Pafnuty Chebyshev became the first person to think systematically in terms of the moments of random variables.},

  abstract = {In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined. For a unimodal distribution, negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. In cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule. For example, a zero value means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall; this is the case for a symmetric distribution, but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat.},

  abstract = {In time series classification and regression, signals are typically mapped into some intermediate representation used for constructing models. Since the underlying task is often insensitive to time shifts, these representations are required to be time-shift invariant. We introduce the joint time-frequency scattering transform, a time-shift invariant representation which characterizes the multiscale energy distribution of a signal in time and frequency. It is computed through wavelet convolutions and modulus non-linearities and may therefore be implemented as a deep convolutional neural network whose filters are not learned but calculated from wavelets. We consider the progression from mel-spectrograms to time scattering and joint timefrequency scattering transforms, illustrating the relationship between increased discriminability and refinements of convolutional network architectures. The suitability of the joint time-frequency scattering transform for time-shift invariant characterization of time series is demonstrated through applications to chirp signals and audio synthesis experiments. The proposed transform also obtains state-of-the-art results on several audio classification tasks, outperforming time scattering transforms and achieving accuracies comparable to those of fully learned networks.},

Classification algorithms including Linear Distinction Analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) classifiers are used to recognize violin and viola instrument sounds. The classification operation is performed on three different sets of features: only time domain features (12), only frequency domain features (4), and both time domain and frequency domain features (16). Simulation results show that the highest accuracy rate is obtained when using the Random Forests classifier with both time and frequency domain attributes. With Random Forest classifier, while obtaining 64.4\% classification accuracy with 10 times cross-validity using only time domain and only frequency domain features, 79.6\% classification success is achieved with both time and frequency domain features.},

As music sound signal is generated using non-linear dynamics, non-linearity and non-Gaussianity of the musical instruments are important features which have not been considered in the past. In this paper, hybridisation of MFCC and Higher Order Spectral (HOS) based features have been used in the task of musical instrument classification. HOS-based features have been used to provide instrument specific information such as non-Gaussianity and non-linearity of the musical instruments. The extracted features have been presented to Counter Propagation Neural Network (CPNN) to identify the instruments and their family. For experimentation, isolated sounds of 19 musical instruments have been used from McGill University Master Sample (MUMS) sound database. The proposed features show the significant improvement in the classification accuracy of the system.},

Recent increases in computational power have allowed the exploration of increasingly detailed features of perceptual significance through simulation approaches. The starting point for any simulation is a well-defined model, usually framed as a system of differential equations, with parameters determined by measurement and experiment. This review article is intended to take the reader through models of string vibration progressively, beginning with well-known and well-studied linear models, and then introducing new features that form the basis for the modern study of realistic musical string vibration. These include, first, nonlinear excitation mechanisms, such as the hammer-string and bow-string interaction, and then the collision mechanism, both for pointwise obstructions and over a distributed region. Finally, the linear model of string vibration is generalized to include geometric nonlinear effects, leading to typical nonlinear behaviour such as pitch glides and the appearance of so-called phantom partials due to nonlinear mixing of modes. The article concludes with a general overview of numerical simulation techniques for string vibration.},

Reinicke and Cremer developed a simple bridge model that shows a typical broad frequency peak around 2.5kHz, because it incorporates the coupling to the violin body and the soundpost. By using the same model, Jim Woodhouse revealed the effect of some parameters of the bridge (mass, stiffness and foot spacing) on the instrument frequency response. Here the parameters of the violin resonance peaks are changed in real time, by applying an active control method. Such a technique, very useful in noise reduction, enabled to change separately the position and the shape of each peak of the bridge input admittance. On the bridge, 2 actuators and an accelerometer are placed at strategic positions in order to change the peak frequency and the damping factor values. The system behaviour is controlled by a Digital Signal Processor. Some sound results achieved with a real violin back up the theoretical equations.},

  abstract = {The identification of material parameters of classical guitars is particularly interesting as the orthotropic material parameters of wood vary largely and lead to hearable differences even in seemingly identical instruments. Identification methods intended to achieve this task commonly try to fit, e.g.,~finite element models to experimental data by minimizing a given objective function, and typically return precise parameter values. However, such one-point estimators do not contain much information with respect to the uncertainty that may remain regarding the true values~--~irrespective of whether such a ground truth can be assumed at all. Model updating techniques that also intend to quantify these uncertainties typically require the practitioner to specify a statistical model of the experiment, which is not easily formulated. Moreover, virtually all uncertainty quantification techniques require a high number of model evaluations, which is diametrically opposed to the long evaluation times of high-fidelity finite element models. In this contribution, an alternative technique for uncertainty quantification based on possibility theory is proposed and applied to a classical guitar. Only requiring the practitioner to specify an objective function, which may be identical to the one used to find point estimates, it is readily accessible and straightforward to apply. Great emphasis is put on the construction of a high-fidelity guitar model and the construction of suitable surrogate models via parametric model order reduction based on Krylov subspace methods, which drastically reduces the number of degrees of freedom in the surrogate model of the finite element model while maintaining the parameter dependency. In this manner, model order reduction allows for significant speedups of the model evaluations and, more importantly here, facilitates the uncertainty quantification in the first place. It is demonstrated how this scheme is able to find regions of plausible parameter values of the guitar and how one may distinguish quasi-identical instruments with great confidence, e.g.,~due to the disjointness of such regions, compared to the moderate confidence implied by more or less disagreeing point estimates. Although motivated by the material parameter identification of guitars, the presented method yields great potential for applicability to inverse problems tackled with finite element models in general.},

The computed BIRs correspond to the transfer function that maps the pickup signal of the electric violin to the radiated acoustic sound of the acoustic violins. By convolution of the pickup signal with the corresponding BIR, we pretend to simulate the radiated sound of the acoustic violin by playing the electric one. The method to obtain the BIRs is based on signal deconvolution between a recorded audio signal of an acoustic violin and the signal coming from an electric violin's pickup. The recorded signals consist of glissandi performed with a violin-playing machine enhanced with motion sensors that provide the bowing parameters (bowing position, velocity and force). By controlling the bowing parameters and analyzing the fundamental frequency of each frame we perform the deconvolution on equivalent frames and obtain the desired impulse response between the two instruments. A user survey consisting of violinists and non-violinists was performed to evaluate the obtained results with respect to the original pickup signal.},

  abstract = {A simplified version of D\"unnwalds timbre parameters for Old Italian Violin Sound; L (bass), ACD-B (un-nasality) and DE-F (clarity) are used to compare the sound of 15 Stradivarius and 15 Guarnerius del Ges\'u violins. The parameters was extracted from 1/12 th octave band played long time average spectra obtained from a CD-recording with the same musical piece played on each of these fine violins. A considerable spread in these parameters and the sound pressure levels were found in both groups of old violins. This spread is used for a direct correlation with the variation in thickness and other geometrical data of some 18 of these Golden age violins. In general, instruments with thinner plates and higher arc height have a statistical tendency of having higher values for L, ACD-B and DE-F and thus sound "more old Italian". But these have a tendency of sounding less loud. In particular the border and average thickness of the back plate is lower for violins with high L and ACD-B and the tops are generally thinner for violins with higher values of DE-F. The development of timbre through Guarneri del Ges\`us career is: towards less bass, more nasal, more clear and a stronger sound. Stradivari seems to have the opposite development through his longer career; Richer in bass, less nasal and slightly less loud with age. He seems to keep his brilliance through his career.},

We develop a timbre model based on the spectral envelope that meets these requirements and relies on additive analysis, Principal Component Analysis and database training. We put special emphasis on the issue of frequency misalignment when training an instrument model with notes of different pitches, and show that a spectral representation involving frequency interpolation results in an improved model. Finally, we show the performance of the developed model when applied to musical instrument classification.},

If evaluations do not fully recognize the potential value of a cultural product, the associated knowledge---especially tacit knowledge---may be lost rather than passed on, thus jeopardizing subsequent attempts to reproduce the valued product. We examine these dynamics by studying how value was attributed to Cremonese stringed instruments. The value the Cremonese masters created was first recognized in the 16th century, and in the early 18th century, new methods to strengthen instrument sound and sonority were developed. However, the value of these new developments was not widely recognized until the 19th century, when, in evaluating musical performance, performers, critics, and public audiences took over from royal courts, and they selected Cremonese instruments as the best for performing the emerging Romantic music. We consider how the dynamics of value determination over time have implications for knowledge management processes.},

First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of t-tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments. A script is supplied to allow the reader to do simulations themselves, with numbers appropriate for their own work.

At least three factors complicate the process: (1) the strings exert three-dimensional forces at the bridge; (2) radiation becomes increasingly directional above 1 kHz; and (3) unless measurements are done under anechoic conditions, the acoustics of the measurement space must be considered. This video describes a rig that uses a solenoid-driven hammer, two driving directions (one horizontal at the bass corner of the bridge; the other vertical at the top-center), and twelve equatorial microphone positions 20 cm from the central axis of the violin. The resulting 24 FRFs can be used to estimate total sound output per-unit-force at the bridge. Alternatively, impulse responses from individual measurements can be convolved with recordings made on an electric violin to create realistic emulations of a normally played violin for use in psycho-acoustic testing.},

  title = {Bow Control and Playability of a Two-Polarisation Time Domain Physical Model of a Bowed String},
  author = {Desvages, Charlotte and Newton, Michael},
  abstract = {Many studies have explored bowed string control, first in theory, and later through experiments and simulations. Bowing control is most commonly described in terms of 3 parameters: downward bow force, bow position, and transverse bow velocity. The correlation between these parameters and the production of a note is generally referred to as the playability of the instrument. The musically-useful region within this parameter space where Helmholtz motion is achieved has been extensively researched. The coordination of these player-controlled parameters is crucial for the existence of steady-state oscillations, but also for their behaviour during note onset. Time domain models of bowed strings require the dynamic input of these physical control parameters. A detailed exploration of this parameter space is therefore of importance for playable physical models. In this work, a two-polarisation bowed string is coupled to a fully dynamic nonlinear lumped bow model. A finite difference scheme is used to solve the discretised equations of motion in the time domain. The bow-controlled input to the model is based on a two-dimensional force vector applied to the bow itself, coupling the two string polarisations. One force component is applied downwards, and the other orthogonally across the string axis, in contrast to the common convention of imposing a downward bow force and transverse bow velocity. The new model has the potential to allow for more realistic and dynamic gesture control. This study explores the parameter space implied by the model, relating it to the playability of the virtual instrument. Analysis of the steady state bow-string dynamics leads to classification of the playing regime, and a graphical representation inspired by the well known Schelleng diagram. The resulting playability-force diagrams may be used as an aid to control of the sound synthesis algorithm.},

The second one deals with the existing relationship between the musical sound and the vibroacoustic properties of the instrument body. The violin is the application of this paper. A proposed solution for the first problem consists in an estimation of the bridge transfer mobility and the mean-value of the lateral bridge transfer mobility. The second problem is studied via the comparison between the amplitudes of harmonics, extracted from a glissando audio signal, and the lateral bridge transfer mobility: Both curves exhibit similar features. This is the main result of the paper. This is evidenced by studying the effect of a violin mute on both the lateral bridge transfer mobility and the produced sound. Finally, this is evidenced by successfully identifying which violin is played in an audio recording, using the computation of the Pearson distance between the distribution of the amplitude of harmonics and a database of measured mobilities.},

  abstract = {Musical instrument recognition is an important aspect of music information retrieval. In this paper, statistical pattern recognition techniques are utilized to tackle the problem in the context of solo musical phrases. Ten instrument classes from different instrument families are considered. A large sound database is collected from excerpts of musical phrases acquired from commercial recordings translating different instrument instances, performers, and recording conditions. More than 150 signal processing features are studied including new descriptors. Two feature selection techniques, inertia ratio maximization with feature space projection and genetic algorithms are considered in a class pairwise manner whereby the most relevant features are fetched for each instrument pair. For the classification task, experimental results are provided using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and support vector machines (SVMs). It is shown that higher recognition rates can be reached with pairwise optimized subsets of features in association with SVM classification using a radial basis function kernel.},

  abstract = {In this paper the realisation of "virtual" musical instruments is analysed, in which the instruments are treated as linear systems, characterised by their impulse response. Various measurements techniques of the impulse response have been tested, employing different transducers and numerical analysis. The better one resulted the direct Maximum Length Sequence excitation signal, applied to the bridge of the violin by a current-to-force transducer. The acoustic pressure radiated from the violin's body is then sampled by a microphone located in an anechoic chamber, and the Impulse Response is obtained by cross-correlation of the acoustic signal with the excitation signal. The impulse responses measured with the technique presented in this paper contain all the timbric and reverberant characteristics of the violin. Langhoff already developed a rating technique that make it possible to extract objective informations about the timbric quality of violins (1): the scope of the present work is to evaluate also the reverberant quality of the instruments. Furthermore, the measurement of the impulse response enables the creation of a "virtual" violin, which is a numerical filter that applied by convolution to an "anechoic" signal add to it all its information. The techniques to obtain such samples of "anechoic" input signals are also discussed here.},

  abstract = {The subjective judgements on ancient violin are influenced by non acoustic phenomena, as the knowledge of the violin maker, the vision of the instruments and, for the performer, also the touch of the violin, the degree of conservation of the instrument, etc. Listening to ``virtual'' instruments let us to consider subjective evaluations in rapid sequences based only on acoustic events, without variation of other parameters, as performer playing, or kind of music, room acoustic, etc. During this study, four ``anechoic'' music samples (Paganini, Bach, Mozart, Paganini), kindly played by Maestro Marco Fornaciari, were digitally recorded. He played on 3 different instruments in an anechoic chamber. Simultaneously the violin bridgeexcitation and the acoustic response of the sound chest were digitally recorded on a two channels DAT , using a velocity transducer and a free field microphone. Subjective pair tests were conducted, to determine the validity of the ``virtual instrument'' technique for comparison with recordings made with the actual different instruments. An arbitrary sequence of ``real'' acoustic signal pairs, convoluted pairs and control pairs (``truly equal'' and ``truly different'' pairs) was created. The results of the listening tests confirmed the excellent degree of similarity between the direct acoustic recording and convolution technique; furthermore the analysis of the two control groups validates the significativity of the test. These results suggest that it will be possible to correlate subjective evaluations and physical characteristics of the instruments, by using the convolution technique. 1 Convolution by Frequency Domain Processing Since some years specialised hardware to perform continuous delayed convolution exist [1], but they are still very expensive and don't allow easily to digitally transfer the input and output signals on a PC. These devices are using Frequency Domain Processing with large blocks of data, resulting in a delay that is 3-4 times larger than the impulse response length. Time domain processing DSP boards, on the other hand, are capable of time domain convolution with no delay, but are limited to a few thousands of filter taps (in the better cases). In this work a software fast convolver (Aurora), running on a standard PC hardware, was employed. The Aurora system make use of a very different approach: both the input and output data files are stored on the hard disk in standard WAV format and, once convolution is performed, comparative tests can easily be conducted with just a ``point and click'' delay. Convolution is performed through the well known ``select-save'' algorithm [2]: details and performances of the convolution software were already published in [3]. Now the program has been extended to longer impulse responses (up to 200000 taps) and speeded up a lot. This way it can handle the binaural reverberation simulation of large acoustic spaces [4]. 2. Validation of the inverse filtering to recover the ``anechoic'' input signal To validate the procedure of extracting the ``anechoic'' impulse signal from the microphone recordings taken in an anechoic chamber, a preliminary test was conducted. 4 ``anechoic'' input signals were recovered from microphone recordings of 4 different music pieces (2 of Paganini, one of Bach and the last of Mozart), with the technique already described in [5]; then they were convoluted with the impulse response of the same violin. These signals resulted almost indistinguishable from the original ones when listened in a normally reverberant space, whilst in headphone listening a little increase in the reverberation can be evidenced for the convoluted signals, for the reasons explained in [5]. In any case, the timbric perception was almost perfect, and this is the most important aspect for violins. 3. Subjective Test to Compare the Acoustic Quality of Violins For a long time many peoples were studying the acoustic characterisation of musical instruments using conventional methods (i.e., by comparing the music played on different instruments); today, by using the novel convolution technique, it is possible to correlate the objective acoustic properties of violins with subjective evaluations without the need to collect dozens of performance recordings over different instruments. To test the feasibility and robustness of the new technique, a large pair comparison test was conducted, with the aim to evaluate the subjective perceptibility of differences among different instruments. Four different Instruments were employed for this test: the first is an ancient Violin (Klotz), kindly offered from the Cremona's making school, the second is an other ancient Violin, (Calcanius), and the last violin is a Langhoff. At the end, a very different timbric Instrument, a viola, was utilised to create ``really different'' pairs. Two ``anechoic'' samples were used for the test: a music piece of Paganini and one of Bach. The music pieces were kindly played by Maestro Marco Fornaciari. The ``anechoic'' input samples were obtained by deconvolution of the impulse response of the Langhoff's violin from the pressure signals directly recorded in anechoic chamber during the music playing, as already described in [5]. The ``anechoic'' input samples so obtained were convoluted with the measured impulse responses of the different instruments. Thus 3 pairs of convoluted samples were obtained. At the other hand, 3 pairs of ``microphonic pieces'' were added to the set of data, in which the presentation order was randomly shuffled. To obtain comparison data, two ``control groups'' each of 3 pairs of samples were mixed with the ``true comparisons'' set: 3 ``really equal'' pairs (obtained playing twice the same sample) and 3 ``really different'' pairs (obtained with convoluted pairs in which each violin is compared to the viola). The same iteration was repeated for each kind of music: Paganini and Bach, in order to get 24 total pairs. 9 subjects were asked to listen to the 24 pairs, filling up for each pair the following questionnaire: Pair no. .......... Are the two violins A and B the same? yes {$\pi$} no {$\pi$} If Your response is no, explain why: a lot (-2) slightly (-1) no difference (0) slightly (+1) a lot (+2) A is better {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} B is better A has more pronounced bass {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} B has more pronounced bass A has more pronounced treble {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} B has more pronounced treble A is softer {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} {$\pi$} B is softer 3.1 Subjective results The following table summarises the results of the first question (percentage of ``equality''): Convoluted samples Microphonic samples Truly equal samples Truly different samples 14.6 \% 12.5 \% 75 \% 0 \% These percentages show that convoluted simulations have actually almost the same degree of dissimilarity as microphonic recording. But the truly equal and truly different samples are clearly recognised by the listeners. Analysing the other 4 responses, the following three tables are obtained for the three violins studied, showing the average value and the standard deviation of each response: Langhoff Violin Conv. samples Microph. samples Equal samples Different samples better -0.69 \textpm{} 0.83 -0.28 \textpm{} 1.01 0.0 \textpm{} 0.71 0.37 \textpm{} 1.41 pronounced bass -0.28 \textpm{} 0.81 -0.31\textpm{} 0.98 0.0 \textpm{} 0.35 -0.56 \textpm{} 1.22 pronounced treble -0.37 \textpm{} 1.01 0.0 \textpm{} 1.05 0.0 \textpm{} 0.50 1.44 \textpm{} 0.93 soft -0.16 \textpm{} 1.18 -0.19 \textpm{} 1.11 0.06 \textpm{} 0.56 -0.75 \textpm{} 0.97 Klotz Violin Conv. samples Microph. samples Equal samples Different samples better -0.16 \textpm{} 1.17 -0.03 \textpm{} 1.01 0.19 \textpm{} 0.39 0.75 \textpm{} 1.48 pronounced bass 0.34 \textpm{} 0.93 0.12 \textpm{} 1.25 -0.13 \textpm{} 0.33 -1.06 \textpm{} 0.97 pronounced treble -0.19 \textpm{} 1.03 -0.09 \textpm{} 1.05 0.13 \textpm{} 0.48 1.25 \textpm{} 0.83 soft 0.03 \textpm{} 1.03 0.09 \textpm{} 1.06 -0.06 \textpm{} 0.43 -0.75 \textpm{} 1.20 Calcanius Violin Conv. samples Microph. samples Equal samples Different samples better 0.44 \textpm{} 1.05 0.72 \textpm{} 1.17 -0.13 \textpm{} 0.48 0.12 \textpm{} 1.05 pronounced bass -0.03 \textpm{} 1.10 0.16 \textpm{} 1.05 -0.19 \textpm{} 0.53 -1.06 \textpm{} 0.97 pronounced treble 0.19 \textpm{} 0.93 0.47 \textpm{} 1.06 0.19 \textpm{} 0.53 1.25 \textpm{} 0.83 soft 0.16 \textpm{} 1.09 0.06 \textpm{} 1.17 -0.13 \textpm{} 0.60 -0.19 \textpm{} 1.18 It can be observed that the values of convoluted samples pairs are very near to those obtained from microphonic samples, as the differences are always lower than the standard deviations. On the other hand, the control groups show very different responses, that approach almost perfectly zero for the truly equal pairs, and exhibit extreme values for the truly different pairs. This effect can be observed in a more evident way by looking at the graphs of fig. 1. The truly equal pairs always show a strong peak on the ``0'' (equality), while the truly different pairs show an evident trend toward an extreme of the scale. This is due to the fact that actually the viola is a very bad instrument compared to three violins (question n. 1), it has more pronounced bass (question 2), it does not have treble (question 3), and is certainly softer than the violins (question 4).},

A method was used which enabled the same performance to be replayed on different ``virtual violins,'' so that the relationships between acoustical characteristics of violins and perceived qualities could be explored. Recordings of real performances were made using a bridge-mounted force transducer, giving an accurate representation of the signal from the violin string. These were then played through filters corresponding to the admittance curves of different violins. Initially, limits of listener performance in detecting changes in acoustical characteristics were characterized. These consisted of shifts in frequency or increases in amplitude of single modes or frequency bands that have been proposed previously to be significant in the perception of violin sound quality. Thresholds were significantly lower for musically trained than for nontrained subjects but were not significantly affected by the violin used as a baseline. Thresholds for the musicians typically ranged from 3to6dB for amplitude changes and 1.5\%--20\% for frequency changes. Interpretation of the results using excitation patterns showed that thresholds for the best subjects were quite well predicted by a multichannel model based on optimal processing.},

  abstract = {Many researchers have sought explanations for the purported tonal superiority of Old Italian violins by investigating varnish and wood properties, plate tuning systems, and the spectral balance of the radiated sound. Nevertheless, the fundamental premise of tonal superiority has been investigated scientifically only once very recently, and results showed a general preference for new violins and that players were unable to reliably distinguish new violins from old. The study was, however, relatively small in terms of the number of violins tested (six), the time allotted to each player (an hour), and the size of the test space (a hotel room). In this study, 10 renowned soloists each blind-tested six Old Italian violins (including five by Stradivari) and six new during two 75-min sessions---the first in a rehearsal room, the second in a 300-seat concert hall. When asked to choose a violin to replace their own for a hypothetical concert tour, 6 of the 10 soloists chose a new instrument. A single new violin was easily the most-preferred of the 12. On average, soloists rated their favorite new violins more highly than their favorite old for playability, articulation, and projection, and at least equal to old in terms of timbre. Soloists failed to distinguish new from old at better than chance levels. These results confirm and extend those of the earlier study and present a striking challenge to near-canonical beliefs about Old Italian violins.},

Results challenge common ideas among violinists about the sound quality associated to the bow.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The automatic assessment of music performance has become an area of increasing interest due to the growing number of technology-enhanced music learning systems. In most of these systems, the assessment of musical performance is based on pitch and onset accuracy, but very few pay attention to other important aspects of performance, such as sound quality or timbre. This is particularly true in violin education, where the quality of timbre plays a significant role in the assessment of musical performances. However, obtaining quantifiable criteria for the assessment of timbre quality is challenging, as it relies on consensus among the subjective interpretations of experts. We present an approach to assess the quality of timbre in violin performances using machine learning techniques. We collected audio recordings of several tone qualities and performed perceptual tests to find correlations among different timbre dimensions. We processed the audio recordings to extract acoustic features for training tone-quality models. Correlations among the extracted features were analyzed and feature information for discriminating different timbre qualities were investigated. A real-time feedback system designed for pedagogical use was implemented in which users can train their own timbre models to assess and receive feedback on their performances.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Of all the characteristics of a violin, those that concern its shape are probably the most important ones, as the violin maker has complete control over them. Contemporary violin making, however, is still based more on tradition than understanding, and a definitive scientific study of the specific relations that exist between shape and vibrational properties is yet to come and sorely missed. In this article, using standard statistical learning tools, we show that the modal frequencies of violin tops can, in fact, be predicted from geometric parameters, and that artificial intelligence can be successfully applied to traditional violin making. We also study how modal frequencies vary with the thicknesses of the plate (a process often referred to as plate tuning) and discuss the complexity of this dependency. Finally, we propose a predictive tool for plate tuning, which takes into account material and geometric parameters.},

The excited vibrations of the body shell are shown to excite a rich spectrum of internal cavity resonances, which are strongly correlated with the radiated sound, particularly in the signature and transitional frequency ranges below around 1.5 kHz for the violin. Examples of how such measurements can be used as a working tool in the luthier's workshop and for research on the acoustics of string instruments of any kind or size are illustrated by measurements on the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.

Therefore, the widespread scale of 12 equal divisions of the just octave is not the best choice to tune instruments like the piano. Basing on the theory of dissonance, we provide a way to tune the piano in order to improve its consonance. A good solution is obtained by tuning a note and its fifth by minimizing their beats.},

The stimuli were computer synthesized based upon an analysis of actual instrument tones, and they were perceptually equalized for loudness, pitch, and duration. Experiment 1 evaluated the tones with respect to perceptual similarities, and the results were treated with multidimensional scaling techniques and hierarchic clustering analysis. A three-dimensional scaling solution, well matching the clustering analysis, was found to be interpretable in terms of (1) the spectral\hphantom{,}energy\hphantom{,}distribution; (2) the presence of synchronicity in the transients of the higher harmonics, along with the closely related amount of spectral\hphantom{,}fluctuation within the the tone through time; and (3) the presence of low-amplitude, high-frequency\hphantom{,}energy in the initial attack segment; an alternate interpretation of the latter two dimensions viewed the cylindrical distribution of clusters of stimulus points about the spectral energy distribution, grouping on the basis of musical instrument family (with two exceptions). Experiment 2 was a learning task of a set of labels for the 16 tones. Confusions were examined in light of the similarity structure for the tones from experiment 1, and one of the family-grouping exceptions was found to be reflected in the difficulty of learning the labels.},

Its popularity exploded in the past 30 years due to the advance ofinformation technology and the need to analyze high-dimensional data sets. Research papers published during these yearswere mostly from the machine learning and artificial intelligence community. The emphasis was largely on improving modelaccuracy using empirical methods; whereas the issue of feature relevance was somewhat overlooked. Feature selection methodswere loosely classified as filters, wrappers, and embedded methods with little attention paid to their intricate details. This paperprovides a tutorial of supervised feature selection, on the basis of reviewing frequently cited papers in this area and a numberof classical publications from the statistics community. The objective of feature selection (either to improve model predictiveaccuracy or to determine relevance for hypothesis generation) is presented and discussed in details. Various supervised featureselection methods are classified using a detailed taxonomy. Guidelines for using feature selection methods in practice areprovided based on a comprehensive review of the performance of these methods. Issues that require further attention are alsodiscussed.},

Series of listening tests were performed separately with recordings of violin tones B3, F\#4, C5, G5 and D6, played on various quality violins. Two main approaches to the discovering of acoustical correlates of most important perceptual features are described. The first approach is directly focused on interpretation of perceptual spaces using acoustic characteristics. The second one uses selected verbal attributes used by listeners to the description of timbre differences and tries to found their explanation using acoustic characteristics. Method of immersion of acoustic characteristic into perceptual space revealed the importance of the first harmonic, higher harmonics and spectral centre of gravity in all studied tones. The change of their relations (similarity, contradiction, or independence) with changing pitch is also discussed. Mutual relations of verbal attributes sharp, dark, clear and narrow in sounds of five studied tones are discovered; acoustical correlates of the main attributes sharp and narrow are found, compared and discussed. Moreover acoustical correlates of attribute rustle in high violin tones are mentioned. Findings of both approaches to the study of timbre are compared and discussed.},

For this purpose, the bridge FRF measurement was carried out, and a psychoacoustic test was conducted. The material from which the tailpiece is made to the greatest extent affects the modal frequencies in the range 530--610 Hz (mode B1+), which mainly manifested itself in a change in the instrument's timbre in terms of the brightness factor. The study showed that the lighter the tailpiece, the darker the sound of the violin.

Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation - Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.},

  abstract = {Recognition of musical instruments in multi-instrumental, polyphonic music is a difficult challenge which is yet far from being solved. Successful instrument recognition techniques in solos (monophonic or polyphonic recordings of single instruments) can help to deal with this task. We introduce an instrument recognition process in solo recordings of a set of instruments (bassoon, clarinet, flute, guitar, piano, cello and violin), which yields a high recognition rate. A large and very diverse solo database (108 different solos, all by different performers) is used in order to encompass the different sound possibilities of each instrument and evaluate the generalization abilities of the classification process. First we bring classification results using a very extensive collection of features (62 different feature types), and then use our GDE feature selection algorithm to select a smaller feature set with a relatively short computation time, which allows us to perform instrument recognition in solos in real-time, with only a slight decrease in recognition rate. We demonstrate that our real-time solo classifier can also be useful for instrument recognition in duet performances, and improved using simple ?source reduction?.},

These coefficients are reduced using principal component analysis and used to train a multi-layered perceptron. The network is trained on the first 3, 4 and 5 principal components calculated from the envelope of the changes in the coefficients. This trained network is then used to classify novel input samples. By training and testing the network on a different number of coefficients, the optimum number of coefficients to include for identifying a musical instrument is determined. We conclude that using 4 principal components from the first 15 coefficients gives the most accurate classification results.}

Using 70\%/30\% splits between training and test data, maximum a\hphantom{,}posteriori classifiers were constructed based on Gaussian models arrived at through Fisher multiple-discriminant analysis. The classifiers distinguished transient from continuant tones with approximately 99\% correct performance. Instrument families were identified with approximately 90\% performance, and individual instruments were identified with an overall success rate of approximately 70\%.

The data were analyzed with an extended version of the multidimensional scaling algorithm CLASCAL (Winsberg \& De Soete, 1993), which estimates the number of latent classes of subjects, the coordinates of each timbre on common Euclidean dimensions, a specificity value of unique attributes for each timbre, and a separate weight for each latent class on each of the common dimensions and the set of specificities. Five latent classes were found for a three-dimensional spatial model with specificities. Common dimensions were quantified psychophysically in terms of log-rise time, spectral centroid, and degree of spectral variation. The results further suggest that musical timbres possess specific attributes not accounted for by these shared perceptual dimensions. Weight patterns indicate that perceptual salience of dimensions and specificities varied across classes. A comparison of class structure with biographical factors associated with degree of musical training and activity was not clearly related to the class structure, though musicians gave more precise and coherent judgments than did nonmusicians or amateurs. The model with latent classes and specificities gave a better fit to the data and made the acoustic correlates of the common dimensions more interpretable.},

To this end, three violins with medium backs, each paired with a thin, normal, or thick top and three with medium tops, each paired with a thin, medium, or thick back were made. Despite careful control and reduction of the influence of handwork by a numerically controlled machining cutting means on the outside of the plates, there remains various sources of variability, in particular in the wood properties. In order to separate the effect on the vibratory behavior of the intentional thickness variations from irreducible variability in wood properties and geometric tolerance, a complete finite element model is being developed using COMSOL software. This model takes into account the geometry of the Bilbao project violins while the wood properties are obtained by optimising the numerical vibratory behavior to match the experimental modal data of the free plates, just after they were CNC routed. This paper explains in detail this optimisation process and show the results for the six top and six back plates. The proposed approach enables the identification of material properties in multiple directions and ensures a step-by-step control of the accuracy of the modeled parts compared to the real ones.},

The various source/receiver positions and orientation examined during these tests correspond to typical positions occupied by human speakers in rooms. It was found that the response functions changed drastically with the variation of these recording parameters. The feasibility of inverting (deconvolving) such functions by using digital signal processing techniques was also examined. It was found that when the exact response function was employed, then such an operation was feasible, leading to enhancement and reduction in the reverberant energy present in signals (e.g., speech) recorded under similar conditions. However, when a response recorded at a different position in the same enclosure was employed, then, in general, the inverse filtering operation increased the distortions present in the signals. This indicates that signal dereverberation by impulse response deconvolution has a limited scope in most practical situations.},

In that direction, this paper investigates two aspects: (a) a novel approach to detect presentation attacks where, unlike conventional approaches, no speech signal modeling related assumptions are made, rather the attacks are detected by computing first order and second order spectral statistics and feeding them to a classifier, and (b) generalization of the presentation attack detection systems across databases. Our investigations on ASVspoof 2015 challenge database and AVspoof database show that, when compared to the approaches based on conventional short-term spectral features, the proposed approach with a linear discriminative classifier yields a better system, irrespective of whether the spoofed signal is replayed to the microphone or is directly injected into the system software process. Cross-database investigations show that neither the short-term spectral processing based approaches nor the proposed approach yield systems which are able to generalize across databases or methods of attack.

The Timbre Toolbox provides a comprehensive set of descriptors that can be useful in perceptual research, as well as in music information retrieval and machine-learning approaches to content-based retrieval in large sound databases. Sound events are first analyzed in terms of various input representations (short-term Fourier transform, harmonic sinusoidal components, an auditory model based on the equivalent rectangular bandwidth concept, the energy envelope). A large number of audio descriptors are then derived from each of these representations to capture temporal, spectral, spectrotemporal, and energetic properties of the sound events. Some descriptors are global, providing a single value for the whole sound event, whereas others are time-varying. Robust descriptive statistics are used to characterize the time-varying descriptors. To examine the information redundancy across audio descriptors, correlational analysis followed by hierarchical clustering is performed. This analysis suggests ten classes of relatively independent audio descriptors, showing that the Timbre Toolbox is a multidimensional instrument for the measurement of the acoustical structure of complex sound signals.},

The approach is based on a frame-weighted deconvolution of excitation and response signals. The excitation, consisting of bowed glissandi, is measured with piezoelectric transducers built into the bridge. Radiation responses are recorded in an anechoic chamber with multiple microphones placed at different angles around the violin. The proposed deconvolution algorithm computes impulse responses that, when convolved with any source signal (captured with the same transducer), produce a highly realistic violin sound very similar to that of a microphone recording. The use of motion sensors allows for tracking violin movements. Combining this information with the directional responses and using a dynamic convolution algorithm, helps to improve the listening experience by incorporating the violinist motion effect in stereo.},

These simulations make it possible to listen to a virtual instrument with a mode of operation representative of the musician-instrument interaction. The work consists of studying the contribution of machine learning (ML) methods in the understanding of the relationships between the shape of a trumpet and the sound simulated. The physical model used is based on an acoustical modeling of the resonator, a mechanical model of the excitator, and an aeroelastic coupling between the excitator and the resonator. From different samples of the input impedance of the resonator, time domain simulations are generated to constitute a training set of sounds. Supervised learning is next trained to the data, with the impedance as input and sound descriptors as outputs, using classical ML methods (neural networks). The ML model is finally used to optimize the sound descriptors levels, according to the input impedance. To illustrate the approach, different "targets" for the sound features are considered (brightness, intonation), and a validation is conducted with the simulations. The approach is a first stage toward a "customization" of an instrument according to different perceptual dimensions.},

It is not uncommon for instruments to be mechanically stimulated to accelerate the process. The goal of the present experiment is to determine whether sustained mechanical stimulation of previously unplayed violins produces measurable changes in bridge admittance or radiativity. Our test instruments comprised three sibling violins (Andre Tellis, model 200), two of which were excited continuously for 12 weeks using different methods, while the third served as a control. Once per week during the excitation period, we measured bridge admittance with a laser vibrometer and radiativity in an anechoic chamber for each violin using the hammer tap method. The mass of each violin was also recorded prior to each measurement to account for fluctuations in moisture content. The resulting frequency response functions were analyzed within specific bands for changes that followed a trend over time or exceeded the standard deviation derived from a set of baseline measurements. Preliminary results do not show any significant changes in either the bridge admittance or radiativity for any of the violins.},

One important part of MIR is the research for algorithms to extract meaningful information (called feature data) from music audio signals. Feature data can for example be used for content based genre classification of music pieces. This masters thesis contributes in three ways to the current state of the art: {$\bullet$} First, an overview of many of the features that are being used in MIR applications is given. These methods -- called ``descriptors'' or ``features'' in this thesis -- are discussed in depth, giving a literature review and for most of them illustrations. {$\bullet$} Second, a large part of the described features are implemented in a uniform framework, called T-Toolbox which is programmed in the Matlab environment. It also allows to do classification experiments and descriptor visualisation. For classification, an interface to the machine-learning environment WEKA is provided. {$\bullet$} Third, preliminary evaluations are done investigating how well these methods are suited for automatically classifying music according to categorizations such as genre, mood, and perceived complexity. This evaluation is done using the descriptors implemented in the T-Toolbox, and several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. It turns out that -- in the experimental setup of this thesis -- the treated descriptors are not capable to reliably discriminate between the classes of most examined categorizations; but there is an indication that these results could be improved by developing more elaborate techniques.},

However, despite the myth surrounding these instruments, blindfolded players tendentially prefer to play modern violins. Here, we present a double blind listening experiment aimed at analyzing and comparatively rating the sound timbre of violins. The mythic instruments were listened to among other well regarded and not so well regarded violins. 70 listeners (violin makers of the Cremona area) rated the timbre difference between the simple musical scales played on a test and a reference violin, and the results showed that their preference converged on one particular Stradivari. The acoustical measurements revealed some similarities between the subjective ratings and the physical characteristics of the violins. It is speculated that the myth of Stradivari could have been boosted, among other factors, by the specimens of tonal superior quality, which biased favourably the judgment on his instruments and spread on all of the maker's production. These results contribute to the understanding of the timbre of violins and suggest the characteristics that are in a relationship with the pleasantness of the timbre.},

The system can be described using suitable differential equations. Implicit numerical discretisation methods are known to yield energy consistent algorithms, essential to ensure stability of the timestepping schemes. However, reliance on iterative nonlinear root finders carries significant implementation issues. This paper explores a method recently developed which allows nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations to be solved non-iteratively. Case studies of a mass-spring system and an ideal string coupled with a bow are investigated. Finally, a stiff string with loss is also considered. Combining semi-discretisation and a modal approach results in an algorithm yielding faster than real-time simulation of typical musical strings.},

However, both preference and richness ratings varied widely between individual violinists, likely because musicians conceptualize the same attribute in different ways. To better understand how richness is conceptualized by violinists and how it contributes to the perceived quality of a violin, we analyzed free verbal descriptions collected during a carefully controlled playing task (involving 16 violinists) and in an online survey where no sound examples or other contextual information was present (involving 34 violinists). The analysis was based on a psycholinguistic method, whereby semantic categories are inferred from the verbal data itself through syntactic context and linguistic markers. The main sensory property related to violin sound richness was expressed through words such as full, complex, and dense versus thin and small, referring to the perceived number of partials present in the sound. Another sensory property was expressed through words such as warm, velvety, and smooth versus strident, harsh, and tinny, alluding to spectral energy distribution cues. Haptic cues were also implicated in the conceptualization of violin sound richness.},

Various perceptual tests, including three discrimination tests and a free evaluation test, were conducted. Concepts from Signal Detection Theory were used to calculate a representative sensitivity value, considering participants' sureness in their responses to discrimination tests. Results indicate that participants were sensitive to a substantial variation (10\%) in the position of the centre of mass when holding the bow in the air versus during playing, though they did not seem to perceive minor changes (4\%) significantly. Conversely, participants exhibited sensitivity to both minor (4\%) and substantial (12\%) variations in the moment of inertia while playing, suggesting a heightened awareness of even slight modifications in this parameter. Furthermore, the free evaluation test revealed that the perceived bow weight was influenced by both parameters, while the quality of bouncing bow strokes appeared to be more influenced by the moment of inertia.},

New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum.

The method used here focuses on musicians' perception of spectral components rather than on physical modeling properties. A silent violin which has been designed with particular emphasis on authentic haptic and visual properties is used as interface between musician and virtual body. Binaural transfer functions of real violins measured at the violinist's hearing position serve as initial sound references for further spectral modifications. A filtering software enables highly-detailed modifications in the frequency domain, changing individual resonances or resonance areas while leaving other resonances unaffected. Implementation on an external signal processor provides for real-time sound processing. An application example demonstrates the tools capability: The presented tool can be used, inter alia, to manipulate the vowel quality in violin tones by modifying specific formant properties.},

On the basis of the string-wire geometry, measurement setups can be exactly specified and individually adjusted, allowing for highly accurate repetition in comparative studies. The setup, including a fully automated exciting apparatus as well as a 'silent' quadrochord, is described in detail. Furthermore, the method is compared with the commonly used impact hammer method. Finally, an application in the context of a research project on violin sound quality is briefly described, where the technique is used to measure binaural impulse responses of violins.},

  abstract = {This research was adopted as an internship at IRCAM, Paris. Many groups in the world, are, like the institute, interested in the combination of electronic music and acoustic instruments. A violin was taken as an example for the acoustic instrument, because of its typical frequency-dependent sound radiation. Previous research has shown that different resonances, or modes, of the violin body cause this radiation pattern. To determine the radiation pattern and resonance frequencies, an inverse measurement method is adopted as has been described by Weinreich[3]. In this point of view, the violin was excited externally by a loudspeaker and the vibrations at the violin bridge were picked up by a single calibrated piezo-electric sensor. The results were analysed by a simple peak-searching algorithm and by spatial Fourier decomposition, expressing the violin characteristics in a limited number of parameters. A cube with 6 digitally processed loudspeakers, called La Timee applies the 3D reproduction of the radiation. The system is capable of producing a sound field corresponding to all possible combinations of the spherical harmonics of order 0 and 1. The sound signals are generated by a physical modeling synthesis engine based on the modal theory, called Modalys. This software simulates the vibrations of the different modes of the violin parts, like the strings, bridge and also the violinist's fingers. A vibrating plate represents the resonant body; its parameters for the resonance frequencies, damping and radiation patterns have been matched to the measurements. A tune is made in the program and played on the loudspeaker system. The results were promising, though a disproportionate rate of frequencies above 2kHz was seen in the measured spectrum. Furthermore, it showed that combinations of monopoles and dipoles up to 1.8kHz could describe the characteristics. This is also approximately the maximum frequency that the used version of La Timee can handle, so no information was lost. However, the radiation of the violin is also interesting for frequencies above 1.5kHz, so further development is recommended to reproduce higher frequencies.},

The violins were bowed continuously with an open-frame mechanical bowing machine, while NAH measurements were made on four planes surrounding the instrument. Mappings of the acoustic intensity are presented that show locations of maximum radiation at low and high frequencies with a spatial resolution smaller than the acoustic wavelength.

The tonal/nontonal gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC) are combined to describe the corresponding spectrum contents in this study. In the recognition system, Gaussian mixture models--universal background model (GMM--UBM) is employed to parameterize the distribution of the combined features. In order to evaluate the recognition task of violin individuals, a solo dataset including 86 violins is developed in this study.

In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) made a formal statement that "p-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone" and that "a p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result" or "evidence regarding a model or hypothesis". That said, a 2019 task force by ASA has issued a statement on statistical significance and replicability, concluding with: "p-values and significance tests, when properly applied and interpreted, increase the rigor of the conclusions drawn from data".},

  title = {Discernment of the {{Sound}} of a {{Violin}}},
  author = {Willgoss, Richard and Walker, Robert},
  abstract = {Professional players project personality into the generic sound of a violin. Appositely, outstanding violins have measurable properties, some described subjectively, that differentiate violins apart independent of player. The relative contributions that skill of the player and quality of instrument make to outstanding performances is widely debated. However, an outstanding performance invariably involves both a top player and instrument. This paper reports on testing the hypothesis that high quality violins as a cohort have distinctive sounds that differentiate instruments apart and help define their contribution to performance. Comparative studies to test the hypothesis require sameness in player and in work performed whilst changing the instrument and also a need for descriptors used to be relevant, meaningful and comprehensive. A set of recordings has been used in semantic differential tests to discern between sound properties of violins. The recordings were made on instruments that span the making years of both A Stradivari and G Guarneri Del Gesu and already judged very successful samples of the makers' crafts. Two groups of listeners were used, tertiary level music students and professionals, all players of classical instruments. Of the twelve violin samples used, students had significant difficulty in identifying them apart. Professionals were able to hear more distinctively than students, sometimes to a significant extent. A cluster analysis was conducted on the listening results for both groups. Neither the professionals nor students gave answers that clearly distinguished violins made by A Stradivari from those made by G Guarneri Del Gesu in the limited sample used. The generic sound of each violin was also measured by looking at the overtone peaks in the playing of a D6 harmonic. A cluster analysis conducted on their magnitude ratios up to the 10th harmonic was surprisingly similar to that obtained from the student results but less similar to the professional clustering. This may shed light on what it is that professional players hear that is different from the so-called generic violin sound that students seem to be hearing. Correlation checks on violins and descriptors used showed that most but not all the violins were differentiated apart by use of descriptors and some redundancy existed between descriptors.},

The models can be used to explore questions directly relevant to instrument makers and players. The main unresolved question at present concerns the description of the frictional behaviour of rosin, since recent results have shown that the friction model used in most earlier studies is incorrect. Better friction models are being developed in current research.},

Comparative results are shown for some key quantities. Damping trends with frequency are shown to have unexpectedly different forms for violins and for guitars. Linear averaging to estimate the ``direct field'' component gives a simple and clear visualisation of any local resonance behaviour near the bridge, such as the ``bridge hill'', and reveals some violins that show a double hill, while viols show only weak hills, and guitars none at all.},

Suppl. 1 81, S83 (1987)]. In the most successful of these experiments [Boutilion, Weinreich, and Michael, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. Suppl. 1 84, S179 (1988)], the load was a mass attached directly to the bridge. Since the bridge motion is three dimensional, the load impedance is also. The problem involved a 3 \texttimes{} 3 admittance matrix and required nine load/no-load measurements. This was accomplished by using three different acoustic irradiating fields and measuring the vibration velocities in each of the three directions. This paper presents a method of applying a one-dimensional load to the bridge by attaching a cylindrical mass to one end of a long sewing needle and immersing it in an air column to form a surrounding air cushion and to hold it upright. The data acquisition and analysis are reduced to three independent problems requiring only one acoustic field and separate mass loading for each direction. The admittance can be studied as a problem in one, two, or three dimensions. Experimental results in two dimensions will be presented.},

As these descriptors are critically dependent on the training sets, we approach the problem of how to automatically generate suitable training sets and optimize the associated macro-features in terms of discriminant power and informative impact.

In violin performance, the perception of playing styles are mainly affected by the characteristic musical timbre, which is mostly determined by performers, instruments and recording conditions. To verify if timbre features can describe a performer's style adequately, we examine a violinist identification method based on note-level timbre feature distributions. We first apply it using solo datasets to recognise professional violinists, then use it to identify master players from commercial concerto recordings. The results show that the designed features and method work very well for both datasets. The identification accuracy with the solo dataset using MFCCs and spectral constrast features are 0.94 and 0.91 respectively. Significantly lower but promising results are reported with the concerto dataset. Results suggest that the selected timbre features can model performers' individual playing reasonably objectively, regardless of the instrument they play.},
