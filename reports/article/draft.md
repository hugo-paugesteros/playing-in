Introduction
    Topic
        - "Playing-in" : long-term improvement of violin sound quality due to playing
            - strong belief among luthiers and players
                BUT
            - no physical evidence (@Inta, @Piackseck)
    SOTA
        - @Inta, @Piackseck
            - Null results regarding physical changes
            - Gaps
                - physical measurements of the instrument only => no player influence
                - player adaptation not investigated

    Research Hypotheses
        1. Vibro-acoustic evolution : violin properties change due to playing
            OR
        2. Musician adaptation : gestures' adjustments to the violin 


    Proposed Approach
        - Longitudinal study involving
            - 1 "to-be-played" violin, 2 control violins
            - 1 "to-play" player, 10 control players 
        - multimodal assesment
            - Vibro-acoustical measurements : radiativities
            - Musical recordings
            - Subjective violin ratings
            - Listening tests
            - Motion Capture measurements

Methods
    Study Design
        Setup
            - 11 professional violinists
                - 1 that will extensively play the "to-be-played" violin
                - 10 controls
            - 3 "not-played" violins
                - 1 "to-be-played" : selected by the "test" violinist for its "opening potential". Unknown for the other participants
                - 2 controls
        
        Timeline
            - Phase 0
                - violins are checked and adjusted according to the "test" player => same strings, same chinrests
            - Phase 1
                1. Session 1 : Measurements
                    ONE WEEK LATER (to measure variability)
                2. Session 2 : Measurements
            - Playing-in period
                - test violinist plays the test violin daily (some exceptions during concert tours)
                - control violins remain in storage
                - ends when "test" player decides
            - Phase 2
                3. Session 3 : Measurements
            - Phase 3 (post-experiment)
                - Listening tests

    Admittances Measurements
        - Laser vibrometer (ref) + Impact hammer

    Musical Recordings
        For each violinist
            Play each violin for 5-10 min (familiarization phase)
            For each each violin
                Record 7 excerpts of the "repertoire" : a scale, ...
        - Dry large room
        - Pair DPA 4006, 48000Hz
        - all violinists * all violins * 7 excerpts of the "repertoire" (a scale, ...)

    Subjective violin ratings
        Before recordings, rate each violin based on 3 criteria
            - Power
            - Ease of play
            - Beauty of tone

    Motion capture (only for the test violinist)
        Motive + 12 cameras @ 120Hz
        Protocol
            For each violin ("test", 1 control, test violinist's violin)
                Play it for 5-10 min (warming-up and / or familiarization)
                Record 7 excerpts of the repertoire : ...

    Listening test
        - At the end of the experiment
        - Task : rate the difference between the violins in two recordings
        - Subjects : musicians of the experiment + luthiers
        - Stimuli : table
