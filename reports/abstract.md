Can a rarely-played violin improve in sound quality by being played? It is a strong belief among musicians and manufacturers that playing "opens up" an instrument, although no study has been able to demonstrate this effect. 
We have revisited this question by performing multiple types of measurements and by testing an alternative hypothesis: whether the violinist adapts to the instrument.

We conducted a controlled longitudinal study centered on three rarely-played violins. The protocol involved one test violinist who played the target violin daily until she considered it "opened" (six months), two control violins kept in storage, and a group of ten control violinists. To disentangle physical evolution from player adaptation, we performed a multimodal assessment at the beginning and end of the playing period. The protocol included: (1) input admittances measured via laser vibrometry, (2) musical recordings, (3) subjective violin ratings provided by the players, (4) blind listening tests, and (5) motion capture of the test violinist's bowing gestures.

Our results show no evidence of acoustical change in the played violin compared to control instruments, nor do they indicate any adaptation by the player.
